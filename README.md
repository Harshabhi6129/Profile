## 👋 About Me

I’m a **software engineer** who enjoys turning complex ideas into **shippable, reliable systems**.

I design **robust backend services**, build **event-driven architectures**, and wire **AI into real products**. I care deeply about **performance, clarity, and developer experience**. When tools don’t exist, I build them. When constraints appear, I design around them.

> Good software should feel like magic — fast, reliable, and a little bit bold.
